# Character Rig

## Overview

Contains a super simple rig for a character in a standard format.
The 3D model is included, and is deliberatly broken into three
parts (head, body, legs) to allow the head/legs to be moved separately
from the body - for  example, to allow the character to look around.

It is also intended as a starting point for building more complex rigs,
and to be controlled by a separate control system.
